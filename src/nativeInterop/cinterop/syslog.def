noStringConversion = openlog

# The platform.posix interop provides the openlog function, but it performs an automatic
# conversion from const char * to String. This copies the string to a temporary buffer,
# which is immediately freed after the call (I think). Because openlog() expects the ident
# string to remain valid for the lifetime of syslog usage, this causes undefined behavior.
# By disabling string conversion here, we ensure we can pass a stable C pointer manually.
